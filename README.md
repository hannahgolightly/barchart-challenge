The Frontend Mentor challenge to rereate their expenses chart component: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt
I did not have access to the figma design doc, so I tried to recreate it as faithfully as possible to the original, using their jpgs and a style guide.
Features dynamically generated bars based on the data they provided in the local JSON file.
